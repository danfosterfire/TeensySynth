	* signal that is close in frequency to a strong one.  It also causes multiple
	* combinations of time and frequency to show the same signal.
	* 
	* The 2048 point real FFT yields 1024 power outputs, corresponding to 0 to 3200 Hz.
	* Only the frequencies up to 2300 Hz are inspected in this implementation.  That
	* corresponds with outputs 0 to 736.  The windowing of the FFT results in frequency
	* resolution that is close to double the bin spacing.  So, the power data is grouped
	* up in 736/2=368 power data points.  It is done twice, using every other bins.
    * Format of export_fft_power[] array:
    * 368 bytes of power for even frequencies, 0, 2, 4, ... 366
    * 368 bytes of power for odd frequencies, 1, 3, 5, ... 367
    * Repeated 14.72/(0.08 sec) = 184 times.
	* The transmitted message length is 12.96 sec so the difference allows timing errors
	* along with the decoding allowing missing symbols.
    * Total bytes saved for decoding is 2 * 368 * 194 = 135424 for the 14.72 seconds.
    *
    * The power byte is log encoded with a half dB MSB.  This can handle a
    * dynamic range of 256/2 = 128 dB.

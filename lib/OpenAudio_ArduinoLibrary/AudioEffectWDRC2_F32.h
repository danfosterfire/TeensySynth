 * Bob Larkin  W7PUA  11 December 2020    ***********  UNDER DEVELOPMENT SUBJECT TO CHANGE!!!!
 * This is an attempt to simplify and further comment the Chip Audette WDRC compressor.
 * Derived from: Chip Audette (OpenAudio) Feb 2017
 * Which was derived From: WDRC_circuit from CHAPRO from BTNRC: https://github.com/BTNRH/chapro

/*
 * WDRC2  Wide dynamic range compressor #2.  Amplifies input signals by a fixed amoount
 * when the input is low.  Above a first knee, the gain is reduce progressively more as
 * the input gets greater.  On a dB out vs. dB in curve, this shows as a chnge in the
 * original 1:1 slope to a lesser slope of 1:cr1 where cr1 is the first compression ratio.
 * Finally there is a second knee where the gain is reduced at an even greater rate.  In the
 * extreme this becomes a hard limiter, but it can continue to increase slightly at a dB
 * rate of 1:cr2, with cr2 the second compression ratio.

 * The graph shows the changes in gain on a log or dB scale.  A 1:1 slope represents
 * a constant gain with level.  When the slope is less, say cr1:1 where cr1 might be 3,
 * the voltage gain is decreasing as the input level increases.
 *
 * The model here is, I believe, the same as the two references above (Audette and CHAPRO).
 * The variable names have been changed to avoid confusion with those of audiologists and
 * to be easier to follow for non-audiologists.  Here goes:
 *   gain0DB  Gain, in dB of the compressor for low level inputs (g0 on graph)  [38 dB]
 *   knee1dB  First knee on the gain curve where the dB gain slope decreases(k1) [-50 dB]
 *   cr1      Compression ratio on dB curve between knee1dB and knee2dB   [3.0]
 *   knee2dB  Second knee on the gain curve where the dB gain slope decreases further (k2) [-20 dB]
 *   cr2      Compression ratio on dB curve above knee2dB  [10.0]
 *
 * The presets for the above quantities, shown in square brackest, are qite aggressive,
 * with a lot of compression (up to 38 dB).  This is for demonstration, and each
 *  situation will have different settings.  For the presets, the following data
 *  was measured, essentiallly as predicted:
 *    vIn (rel full scale)=0.001  vInDB=-60.05  vOutDB-vInDB=38.00
 *    vIn (rel full scale)=0.003  vInDB=-50.47  vOutDB-vInDB=38.00
 *    vIn (rel full scale)=0.01   vInDB=-40.00  vOutDB-vInDB=31.38
 *    vIn (rel full scale)=0.03   vInDB=-30.45  vOutDB-vInDB=24.97
 *    vIn (rel full scale)=0.1    vInDB=-19.98  vOutDB-vInDB=19.98
 *    vIn (rel full scale)=0.3    vInDB=-10.45  vOutDB-vInDB= 9.40
 *    vIn (rel full scale)=1.0    vInDB=  0.01  vOutDB-vInDB=-0.01
 * 
 * vInDB refers to the time averaged envelope voltage.
 * Needing a zero reference, this has been chosen as full ADC range output. This is Â±1.0
 * peak or 0.707 RMS in F32 terminology.  If this is fixed, the low-level gain will also be
 * determined.  This is calculated in the constructor.
 *
 * The curve is for gainOffsetDB = 0.0. This parameter raises and lowers the entire gain
 * curve by this many dB.  This is equivalent to a post-compressor gain (or loss).
 *
 * Note: This is all done in conventional 10 based dB.  This ends up with scaling in
 * several places that could be eliminated by using 2B instead of dB, i.e.,
 * use log2() and 2^().  This would seem to be faster, but less "readable."
